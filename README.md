# TextMann - Your Text Manipulator

**TextMann** is a React-based text utility web app designed to help users perform quick and simple text transformations. It allows converting text to alternating case, copying text, changing case (uppercase/lowercase), removing extra spaces, counting words and characters, and previewing the final result instantly.  
I also added multiple themes to make it visually appealing and fun to use.

The goal behind this project was to strengthen my understanding of React fundamentals, including state management, props, and component interaction.  
Even though this project looks simple, it represents consistent learning, debugging, and effort. Every small feature was built with attention and patience.
